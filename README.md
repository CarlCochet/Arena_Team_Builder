# Arena Team Builder

This is a simple application to theorycraft team compositions for the game Dofus Arena.

This tool is built using the Godot 4 game engine. This version of the engine is still in BETA, so there might be some bugs that are not linked to this repository.
If you want to run the tool in the engine, you will need to download the Godot 4 BETA, you can go here: https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/4.0/beta10/

If you do not wish to modify the project, you can just run a release build (recommended): https://github.com/CarlCochet/Arena_Team_Builder/releases
